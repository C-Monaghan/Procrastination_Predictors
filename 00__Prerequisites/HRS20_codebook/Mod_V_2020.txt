         questions. Some questions may be similar to questions we have already asked, but
         we are interested in how people respond when the questions are changed just a
         little. This will only take a few minutes.

         The next questions are about money and investments.
         
         Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and
         inflation was 2% per year. If you leave the money in the savings account for 1
         year and then withdraw it, will you be able to buy more than you would today,
         exactly the same, or less than today?

         Social Security uses the term Full Retirement Age (FRA) as the age at which a
         person can receive full (unreduced) retirement benefits. The FRA for someone
         born the same year as you is between age 66 and a half and 67.
         
         Suppose that you retired and claimed your Social Security benefits before
         reaching your Full Retirement Age. How do you think the benefits you will
         receive would change, due to the fact that you claimed before the FRA?
         
         Compared to waiting to claim at my Full Retirement Age, I think my benefits will
         be:

         FRA would affect your annual benefits in the years before that age.

         Suppose you were given the choice between the following: receiving a payment in
         12 months or receiving a payment in 24 months. We will now present you five
         situations. The payment in 12 months is the same in each of these situations.
         The payment in 24 months is different in every situation. Please assume there is
         no inflation, i.e. future prices are the same as today's prices. For each of
         these situations we would like to know which you would choose.

         something happening or not happening. Please give a number from 0 to 100, where
         "0" means that you think there is absolutely no chance, and "100" means that you
         think the event is absolutely sure to happen.
         
         Consider a bowl that holds 10 balls. Some of the balls may be white and some
         red. You will be asked to draw one ball without looking. First, suppose this
         bowl has 10 white balls and no red balls. On a scale from 0 percent to 100
         percent, what is the percent chance that the ball you draw is red?

         An insurance policy makes a payment if an uncertain event happens in the future,
         but will not pay anything if the event does not happen. For example, health
         insurance will make a payment if the owner becomes ill and needs treatment, but
         will not pay anything if the owner remains healthy. We will ask your opinion
         about some insurance policies and whether they would be good deals for you. For
         example, a health insurance policy might not be a good deal for someone who is
         sure to remain in good health.
         
         Now imagine that you are offered an insurance policy that pays $100,000 if you
         ever have to move to a nursing home. The policy would cost you $10,000 today.
         Would this policy be a very good deal, a somewhat good deal, a neither good nor
         bad deal, a somewhat bad deal, or a very bad deal for you?

         your job during the next 12 months (and $0 if not). The policy would cost you
         $400 today. Would this policy be a very good deal, a somewhat good deal, a
         neither good nor a bad deal, a somewhat bad deal, or a very bad deal for you?

         $10,000 if you lose your job during next year.
