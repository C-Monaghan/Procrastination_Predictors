<h2 align = "left"> Overview </h2>
<p> Procrastination is a behaviour performed by various age groups. However, over the years, research has predominantly focused on student and younger adult populations, 
with <strong> little attention given to procrastination behaviours among older adults </strong>. This complex behaviour is influenced by a multitude of factors. Through 
previous studies on younger populations, researchers have identified numerous factors closely associated with procrastination. However, to gain a more comprehensive 
and holistic understanding of procrastination, research also needs to take into consideration procrastination in  later life and examine whether these factors also apply to 
older adults. </p>

As such, the objectives of this study were twofold:
<ul>
  <li> Investigate the potential association between age and procrastination. </li>
  <li> Investigate the mediating roles of depressive symptomology and loneliness on procrastination tendencies among older adults. </li>
</ul>
